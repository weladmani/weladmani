# 🖐️ Hi, I'm Elad Mani

I'm a software engineer who loves solving problems in **Python**, **Java**, **C**, **C#** and **JavaScript**. I'm particularly interested in **data mining**, **software development**, and exploring **Machine Learning (ML)**, **large language models (LLMs)** and **retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG)**.

I enjoy building efficient applications and uncovering insights from data. This page showcases some of my projects, skills and education, and where you can find me around the web.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🔧 Assembly Compiler in C

An assembler built in C that converts human‑readable assembly code into machine‑readable binary instructions.

- Implemented parsing, instruction translation and binary code generation from source files to simulate low‑level code execution.
- Dmonstrated understanding of low-level architectures and system programming.
- 🔗 [Code](https://github.com/weladmani/C---Assembler-/tree/main/C-Lab-Project)

### 🧠 Data‑Mining on Stroke Prediction

A data‑mining project for predicting stroke outcomes using the Kaggle stroke prediction dataset.
- Built supervised learning models using Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest.
- Applied unsupervised techniques like K‑Means clustering and association rule mining for exploratory analysis.
- Designed a multi‑layer artificial neural network (ANN) with ReLU activations and a sigmoid output for binary classification.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall and F1‑score.
