# 👋 Hi, I’m Elad Mani

I’m a software engineer from Tel Aviv who loves solving problems in **C**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**. I’m particularly interested in **data mining**, **software development in JavaScript and Python**, and exploring **large language models (LLMs)** and **retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG)**.

I enjoy building efficient C applications and uncovering insights from data. This page showcases some of my projects and where you can find me around the web.
