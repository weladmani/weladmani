# 👋 Hi, I’m Elad Mani

I’m a software engineer from Ramat Gan who loves solving problems in **Python**, **Java**, **C** and **JavaScript**. I’m particularly interested in **data mining**, **software development**, and exploring **Machine Learning (ML)**, **large language models (LLMs)** and **retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG)**.

I enjoy building efficient applications and uncovering insights from data. This page showcases some of my projects and where you can find me around the web.
